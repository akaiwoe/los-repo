# Los' Repo
Welcome! This is a repo I have made for my initial experience working with the Git/Github workflow.
I expect this to be the first of many repositories I will be working on in my future coding/software engineering career.

* I pray the God continues to utilize me in a manner to uplift myself, my family, and those around me.
* That he molds me into the type of person and eventually father he'd like me to be.
* That he keeps my family in His grace and that my current and future family recognizes Him as their Lord and Savior.

So far **Los' Repo** is the first repo i have created and worked on and will primarily be where I start/build my experience and contribution's in my career.

**May God Bless Me and whoever may be reading this!**
